# socks5 server in 100 lines

An ultra simple Socks5 server in C#, just for learning the protocol.

However, with .NET8, it has good performance. 

It's tiny(just 130 lines), so it's easy to find protocol details in `program.cs`.

Not completely support Socks5, because it's better and easier to build a more complex or safe connection just based on Socks5 of "No Auth".
